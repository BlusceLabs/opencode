### Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlusceLabs/clawc/main/install | bash
```

#### Installation Directory

The install script respects the following priority order for the installation path:

1. `$CLAWC_INSTALL_DIR` - Custom installation directory
2. `$XDG_BIN_DIR` - XDG Base Directory Specification compliant path
3. `$HOME/bin` - Standard user binary directory (if it exists or can be created)
4. `$HOME/.clawc/bin` - Default fallback

```bash
# Examples
CLAWC_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlusceLabs/clawc/main/install | bash
XDG_BIN_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlusceLabs/clawc/main/install | bash
```

### Agents

ClawC includes two built-in agents you can switch between with the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full-access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multistep tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.
